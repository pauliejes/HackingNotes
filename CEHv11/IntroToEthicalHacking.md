# Intro to Ethical Hacking
- - - -
**Key elements of Information Security:**
	* Confidentiality - Assure info is accessible only to the authorized
	* Integrity - Trustworthiness of data or resources
	* Availability - Assurance that resources are accessible

**Classification of Attacks:**
	* Passive - Monitoring Network Traffic
	* Active - Disrupt Communications or tamper w/ data to bypass/gain access
	* Close-in - Physically close attack like social engineering
	* Insider - Violate rules of an org or steal stuff to gain access
	* Distribution - Tamper with hard/software prior to installation

> What is Hacking?  
> Hacking refers to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to a system  


### 5 Phases:
	1. ~**Reconnaissance**~ 
		* Attacker seeks to gather info on target.
		* Passive Recon
			* Acquiring information without directly interacting with the target. EX: Searching public records.
		* Active Recon
			* Directly interacting with the target by any means such as social engineering.

	2. ~**Scanning**~ 
		* Scanning the network for specific info based on info gathered from recon phase.
		* Look for open ports or system info

	3. ~**Gaining Access**~
		* Attacker gains access at the os, app, or network level.

	4. ~**Maintaining Access**~
		* Keeping access once in the system. EX: Creating a back door

	5. ~**Clearing Tracks**~
		* Make sure you didn’t make a scene. EX: Clearing log files


**Ethical Hackers try to think about these questions:**
		* What can an intruder see on the target system? (Phases 1 and 2)
		* What can an intruder do with that info? (Phases 3 and 4)
		* Does anyone at the target org notice the intruders’ attempts?
		* Are all components of the target system well protected/updated?
		* How much time/effort/money are required to protect the system?
		* Are the information security measures in compliance with legal/industry standards?

**Information Assurance (IA)**
		* IA is the assurance that the integrity, availability, confidentiality, and authenticity of info and info systems is protected during the usage, processing, storage, and transmission of said info.
	
**Several Protection Layers of Defense**

**Risk Management:**
		* Identification - Identify the sources
		* Assessment - Assess the risk to the org
		* Treatment - Select and implement appropriate controls
		* Tracking - Ensures appropriate controls are implimented
		* Review - Evaluate the preformance

**Incident Handling and Response:**
		1. Preperation
		2. Incident Recording and Assignment
		3. Incident Triage
		4. Notification
		5. Containment
		6. Evidence Gathering and Forensic Analysis
		7. Eradication
		8. Recovery
		9. Post-Incident Activities / Review
			* Incident Documentation
			* Incident Impact Assessment
			* Review and Revise Policies
			* Close the Investigation
			* Incident Disclosure
